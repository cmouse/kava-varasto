Storage bookkeeping system for Karhunvartijat ry
================================================

This system is intended to replace sheets based stock management and loaning system for non-profit.

Key requirements for this system:

 - Allow maintaining information about what equipment, and how much should be in storage.
 - Allow mapping equiment with short codes, or by name. (Some equipment has no short code)
 - Simple user management and authentication, only few users for the system. 
 - Needs to work sub-path mounting
 - Must have working mobile and pc UI, especially for borrowing equipment.
 - Must be localizable to Finnish and English, defaulting to Finnish.

Borrowing equipment
-------------------

The process for borrowing the equipment works by marking who is borrowing equipment, which is freeform,
and needs to be mapped to the current user. There should also be information when equipment was borrowed
and when it is suposed to be returned.

There should be way to search equipment by name and short code. Or using category buttons.

Then the borrowed equipment is checked out, and when user returns them, they are checked in.

There are some equipment that is borrowed for members of non-profit only, and small amount of equipment that is borrowed outside.

Short codes
-----------

Most equipment has short codes likes X75, or M96. But some equipment does not.

A short code identifies one specific physical item, so equipment with a short
code always has quantity 1. Equipment with no short code (e.g. "Trangia
stove") is tracked as a stock count instead -- quantity can be more than one,
so we know how many are in storage vs. borrowed. Enforced by
`Equipment.clean()` and a DB check constraint
(`kava_varasto.inventory.models.Equipment`).

Broken equipment
----------------

Equipment can be marked broken via `broken_quantity` (0 by default). For
short-coded items (quantity always 1) this is effectively a broken/not-broken
flag; for bulk stock (e.g. Trangia stoves) it tracks how many of the total are
currently broken, so `available_quantity` (quantity minus broken_quantity)
reflects what can actually be loaned out. Cannot exceed `quantity`, enforced
by `Equipment.clean()` and a DB check constraint.

Categorization
--------------
To make it easier to find equipment, there should be categories of equipment when borrowing, so that equipment with no short code is discoverable.

Listings
--------
All borrows need to be listable as active and old.
